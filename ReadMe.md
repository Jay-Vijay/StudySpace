Hi Everyone! 
This is my Web Development Project, StudySpaceAiml that contains resources from AIML Curriculum 2019 Regulation at Rajalakshmi Engineering College.
It is hosted on netlify through github linkage.

The requirement for StudySpaceAIML arose from a personal vested interest in getting and sharing academic resources well in advance. The goal was to ensure that students could begin preparing for subjects even if there was no immediate exam scheduled or if the course wasn't offered in that particular semester. This kind of early access to study materials helped in building consistency in learning and also supported those who preferred studying at their own pace.

It was feasible to implement this idea using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring good structure, clean design, and smooth functionality. I used these technologies to create and interlink multiple pages of the website based on semester-wise categorization. The aim was to keep the interface minimal, accessible, and fast.

Once the website pages were built, they were hosted by linking GitHub with Netlify, which ensured a free and stable deployment workflow. For document management, I integrated Firebase Storage, where all PDFs and academic files were stored. On each semester page, clicking the relevant link allows users to access the stored documents directly.

StudySpaceAIML was created keeping simplicity and usability in mind. The entire structure was kept lightweight so it could load easily. It also helped peers easily navigate and locate specific materials such as notes, textbooks, or previous year papers without dealing with cluttered interfaces or login restrictions.

The project was a good opportunity to independently apply front-end development skills with live hosting and cloud storage, while also solving a real problem within the student community.
